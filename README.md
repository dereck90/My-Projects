# My-Projects
Projects I've done in college.<br>
<br>
1. HealthCare Doctor Directory<br>
  This is a software that I made to store information into a Database.<br>
<br>
2. Number Analyzer<br>
  This software takes an input of a math ecuation and it verifies if its valid.<br>
  Examples: 4.5+2 = valid | 46*32 = valid | 6.5*7.4 = valid | 45-/2.1 = invalid | 54.3+-/3.3 = invalid | 4.6.9+39 = invalid<br>
